By adjusting the parameters such as temperature, token count, and penalties, the AI's tone and length of the product description changed noticeably. Lower temperatures produced more deterministic and factual responses, while higher temperatures introduced creativity and variation. Increasing max_tokens generally led to more detailed outputs, and higher penalties reduced repetition and encouraged diverse vocabulary.

Compared to the user-chosen configuration, some combinations generated verbose, imaginative descriptions while others were concise and business-like. This demonstrates how fine-tuning the parameters can help tailor the tone and style of responses, depending on the intended audience or use-case.
